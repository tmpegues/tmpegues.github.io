## Overview
I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Caltech and am currently pursuing a Master's of Science in Robotics at Northwestern University. That undergraduate experience included projects designing and fabricating robotic arms and exoskeletons along with implementation of computer vision systems; I also has professional experience as a structures engineer for major appliances.  My main professional interests are assistive and medical devices for both rehabilitative and augmentative purposes.

### Research interests
* Prosthetics and other assistive devices
* Surgical robotics and medical applications
* All manners of bio-inspired engineering
