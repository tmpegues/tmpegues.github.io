## Overview
This project was completed for Northwestern's [MECH_ENG 450: Embedded Systems in Robotics](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/mechanical/academics/courses/descriptions/450-embedded-systems-in-robotics.html). My teammates were Rishika Bera, Nolan Knight, and Halley Zhong, all MSR '26.

My team chose sorting HexBugs by color as the task for our Franka arm to perform. This task was split into 3 main tasks: determining the location of our camera relative to the robot, determining the positions of the points of interest (HexBugs, sorting locations) relative to the camera, then moving the robot based on that information. My primary focus was motion, but this was a collaborative effort and I did make contributions to vision well.
